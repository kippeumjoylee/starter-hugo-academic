        <h3>Strategic Network Decisions and Knowledge Spillovers: Evidence from R&D collaborations of the U.S. Firms &#40;JMP&#41</h3>
        <details>
          <summary>Abstract</summary>
          <p>This paper provides a framework to examine the effect of private R&D investment on productivity in the presence of R&D collaborations and subsequent knowledge spillovers. While existing literature emphasizes the direct effects of R&D on innovation and cost reduction, it is often overlooked that R&D investment also affects the formation of collaborative networks. Investing in R&D enhances a firm's learning capacity and augments its appeal as a collaboration partner, thereby increasing the propensity for forming R&D collaborations. Consequently, the effect of R&D is underestimated without considering its additional role in fostering collaborations. To bridge the gap, I develop a dynamic model of a firm that internalizes its decision on whom to collaborate with and following spillovers. This framework allows a firm's R&D investment to improve productivity and affect the collaboration network, and each firm has different propensities for forming collaborations. Using the U.S. R&D-intensive firms and their firm-to-firm R&D collaborations data during 1980-2001, I find that private R&D increases the probability of engaging in collaborations and the expected number of collaborators. When considering these factors together, a 10 percent increase in R&D yields a long-term efficiency gain of 0.35 percent, which is 14% larger than the traditional model with the exogenous network.</p>

        <h3>Joint Bidding, Information Sharing, and the Winner's Curse in First-Price Common Value Auctions</h3>

          <summary>Abstract</summary>
          <p>In a first-price common value auction, bidders tend to bid less aggressively in consideration of the winner's curse. It worsens when the number of bidders increases, the quality of information is poor, or they face high risks. Joint bidding could alleviate these problems and be advantageous even to a seller by relieving the winner's curse and increasing budgets, thus letting bidders bid more aggressively. Understanding how beneficial joint bidding could be is important because it could suggest whether a government should ban or allow joint bidding in procurement auctions with common value features. However, there is little empirical evidence on the effects of joint bidding in common value auctions. In this paper, we study joint bidding behavior and its impacts on bids and the winner's curse using the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) auctions from 1954 to 1975. We suggest reduced form evidence that joint bidding increases the amounts of bids. To address the potential endogeneity problem in joint bidding, we introduce a novel instrument utilizing a new dataset of firms' office addresses recorded in lease contract agreements. Empirical results reveal that joint bidders submit approximately 75% higher bids than solo bidders on average. We then build a structural model of asymmetric common value auctions by dividing bidders into joint and solo types. Based on the estimation of the winner’s curse, we find that solo bidders experience a more substantial winner’s curse relative to joint bidders.</p>
