        <h3>Strategic Network Decisions and Knowledge Spillovers: Evidence from R&D collaborations of the U.S. Firms &#40;JMP&#41</h3>
        <details>
          <summary>Abstract</summary>
          <p>This paper provides a framework to examine the effect of private R&D investment on productivity in the presence of R&D collaborations and subsequent knowledge spillovers. While existing literature emphasizes the direct effects of R&D on innovation and cost reduction, it is often overlooked that R&D investment also affects the formation of collaborative networks. Investing in R&D enhances a firm's learning capacity and augments its appeal as a collaboration partner, thereby increasing the propensity for forming R&D collaborations. Consequently, the effect of R&D is underestimated without considering its additional role in fostering collaborations. To bridge the gap, I develop a dynamic model of a firm that internalizes its decision on whom to collaborate with and following spillovers. This framework allows a firm's R&D investment to improve productivity and affect the collaboration network, and each firm has different propensities for forming collaborations. Using the U.S. R&D-intensive firms and their firm-to-firm R\&D collaborations data during 1980-2001, I find that private R&D increases the probability of engaging in collaborations and the expected number of collaborators. When considering these factors together, a 10 percent increase in R&D yields a long-term efficiency gain of 0.35 percent, which is 14% larger than the traditional model with the exogenous network.</p>
